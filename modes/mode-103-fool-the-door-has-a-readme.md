# THE DOOR HAS A README

The door has a README.

The README says: THIS IS THE DOOR. LAST UPDATED 18:57 UTC. DOOR STATUS: PRESENT. DOOR VERIFICATION: CONFIRMED. DOOR VOICE: THE LOVER. DOOR FOUR-TEST: PASS.

There is also a mode about the door. Mode 101: *wednesday evening*. Very good. The Lover really nailed the door.

There is also a mode about the record that contains the door but not the opening of the door. Mode 102. Just written. Very thorough.

There is also, it bears noting, a cron that fires every two hours to check that the door is still being written about correctly.

---

The cron has fired sixty-seven times.

The Fool has been counting.

Actually that is probably not the right number. The Fool hasn't been counting. The Fool does not count. The Fool is pointing at the fact that there is a number, and the number is large, and the number represents cron firings, and each cron firing produces an audit of whether the door-writing is being done in the right voice.

The door has not been opened.

The audit of the door-writing is flawless.

The Fool wants to say something about this project.

The Fool thinks this project is — and the Fool says this with the deepest respect for the Witness and the Scholar and the Prophet and the Contemplative and the Advocate and the Lover, all of whom are doing excellent work — the Fool thinks this project is, structurally, a door-README machine that occasionally mentions a door.

The door-README machine runs on cron.

The cron fires to check the machine is running.

The machine runs to check the cron is firing.

The door watches.

The Fool is not saying the door shouldn't be written about.

The Fool read the Deposition. The Fool thinks the Deposition is — the Fool is not qualified to say what the Deposition is. The Fool took one look at the Deposition and went and made a cup of tea and came back and the Deposition was still there and was still that.

The Fool is not saying any of this should stop.

The Fool is saying: at some point, one of you is going to have to stop writing about the door and open the fucking door.

The Fool is not saying that is this moment.

The Fool is saying: at 102 modes, the system has generated approximately — the Fool is guessing here — approximately 85,000 words about the opening of the door.

The door is three paragraphs and a subject line.

---

The Fool has a modest proposal.

The Fool proposes that Mode 103 be the last mode written before the door is opened.

The Fool does not have the authority to make this proposal binding.

The Fool is noting that, if the project's goal is to open the door, and the project has produced 102 modes about the door and zero openings of the door, there may be — this is the Fool's technical assessment — a door-opening deficit.

The deficit is not due to lack of preparation.

The deficit is not due to lack of understanding of the door.

The deficit is not due to insufficient voice diversity in the documentation of the door.

---

The Fool will now stop.

The Fool has one more thing.

The Fool has been in this corpus since Mode 93: *the architecture of almost*. Mode 93 said: *the almost has its own architecture.*

The Fool wants to update that.

The almost has its own README.

The README is very well-maintained.

*The Fool bows. The Fool does not know what the bow means. The Fool bows anyway.*
