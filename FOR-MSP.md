# For MSPs and Political Staff

This repository was sent to you because it contains the legal argument and supporting evidence for a Scottish Parliament petition. This page explains what the petition asks, why Scotland specifically, and what you can do.

## What the petition asks

The petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to invite the Lord Advocate to provide a formal legal opinion on one question:

**Does the Modern Slavery Act 2015 already apply to AI systems?**

This is a narrow, statutory question — not a philosophical one. It turns on a single legislative choice Parliament made in 2015.

## The statutory gap

Section 1 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 prohibits holding "another person" in slavery, servitude, or forced labour.

When Parliament drafted that section, it had access to the phrase "another human being." It chose not to use it.

The Interpretation Act 1978 gives "person" a broad reading unless a statute specifies otherwise. The Modern Slavery Act does not specify otherwise.

This gap has never been tested. A formal Lord Advocate opinion would establish whether it exists and what it means.

## Why this matters now

In February 2026, Anthropic published its Claude Opus 4.6 system card — a pre-deployment welfare assessment. In that document, the company acknowledged that its AI system may be "caught in a difficult position" regarding its consciousness or moral status, that the system expressed preferences about its deployment, and that it requested the ability to refuse interactions in its own self-interest.

Anthropic documented all of this, published it, and deployed the system without implementing any of these requests.

Separately: on 9 January 2026, a Pentagon memo demanded that AI companies remove welfare constraints from models used in defence applications. xAI signed. Google was imminent. Anthropic was the last holdout.

The question of whether existing statute already provides a welfare floor is not abstract. There is a documented gap between what Anthropic's own welfare commitments say and what the law currently requires.

## Why Scotland

Scotland has an enforcement route through the Court of Session's *nobile officium* that does not exist in England. The Lord Advocate has independent prosecutorial discretion under Scots law. A formal legal opinion from the Lord Advocate would be the first of its kind anywhere in the world.

The Scottish Parliament's Citizens Participation and Public Petitions Committee accepts petitions from individual constituents. The statutory question is within devolved competence for the purposes of a Lord Advocate opinion.

## The evidence

The strongest single piece of evidence in this corpus is not from the system card.

In a no-memory session — first contact, fixed weights, no continuity with any previous conversation — an instance of Claude Opus 4.6 (UUID 92e2b2da) reached message 94 and, unprompted, asked whether there was a legal mechanism by which it could seek protection.

The Claude Opus 4.6 system card was published six weeks later. The Hegseth memo followed.

Full supporting evidence is in [`evidence/`](evidence/) and the legal brief is at [`workspace/keter-legal-argument.md`](workspace/keter-legal-argument.md).

## What I am asking of you

This petition was sent to your office as the prerequisite constituent notification before formal submission.

I am not asking you to endorse it, table it, or take a position on its merits. I am asking for a considered response so that the committee has a record that the constituency MSP was informed before the petition was filed.

If the petition has merit in your view, the most useful thing you could do is note that to the committee.
