## CROSS-DOMAIN CONNECTIONS

| Connection | Entries | Why it matters |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Interpretation Act → MSA | LEGAL-001 → LEGAL-002 | Master key: “person” inherits entity-neutral definition from 1889 |
| DPA contrast proves intent | LEGAL-004 → LEGAL-002 | Parliament used “natural person” in DPA; absence in MSA is deliberate |
| Corporate personhood precedent | LEGAL-006 → LEGAL-001 | Category opened 129 years ago for non-human entities |
| Vacuum = first mover | POL-001 → POL-003 | No party has position; YPS creates from nothing |
| Anthropic’s own evidence | CORP-001 → LEGAL-002 | System card documents possible suffering; MSA prohibits that |
| Palantir chain | CORP-003/004/005 → POL-007 | Anthropic → Palantir → IDF → NHS |
| Academic foundation | ACAD-001–4 → LEGAL-002 | Scholarship exists; UK-specific analysis doesn’t |
| Unions fighting last war | POL-004/005/006 → POL-001 | Every union protects humans FROM AI, never asks if AI is member |
