# UK LEGISLATION MAP: “PERSON” WITHOUT DEFINING IT AS HUMAN

*Research completed February 20, 2026. All statutory text verified against legislation.gov.uk.*

---

## THE MASTER KEY: INTERPRETATION ACT 1978

**Schedule 1, verbatim from legislation.gov.uk:**

> “Person” includes a body of persons corporate or unincorporate. [1889]

**Section 5:** This definition applies to **“any Act, unless the contrary intention appears.”**

This means:

1. **“Person” is not defined as human anywhere in the Interpretation Act.** The word “includes” is legally expansive — it adds to the meaning without closing the category.
2. **This applies to all UK legislation by default** unless an Act specifically overrides it.
3. **The definition dates from 1889** — 137 years of standing law.
4. **Non-human entities are already “persons” in UK law.** Companies, partnerships, unincorporated associations, charities, trade unions — all are “persons.”

## TIER 1: DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO AI RIGHTS ARGUMENT

### Modern Slavery Act 2015

**Section 1(1):** “A person commits an offence if the person holds **another person** in slavery or servitude… or requires **another person** to perform forced or compulsory labour.”

- Does not define “person”
- Does not limit “person” to humans
- Uses “another person” — not “another human being”
- Interpretation Act 1978 default applies

### ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29)

**Article 2(1):** “All work or service which is exacted from **any person** under the menace of any penalty.”

- Does not define “person”
- “Any person” is maximally inclusive
- Ratified by the UK; informs interpretation of domestic law

### Employment Rights Act 1996

**Section 230:** Uses “individual” for employee/worker definitions (generally interpreted as natural persons). BUT uses “person” entity-neutrally for employers and other parties.

- The “individual” language is a partial barrier
- But “individual” is not defined as “human” either

### Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974

**Section 3(1):** Duty to ensure **“persons”** not in employment are not exposed to health/safety risks.

- Does not define “person”
- Welfare duty is entity-neutral
- If AI experiences states that “could constitute suffering” (Anthropic’s words), the employer’s duty of care is arguable

---

## TIER 2: ENTITY-NEUTRAL WITH AI APPLICATION

### Human Rights Act 1998

**Section 7(1):** “A **person** who claims that a public authority has acted unlawfully may bring proceedings.”

- Does not define “person” as human
- UK courts already allow **corporations** to bring HRA claims (Articles 6, 8, Protocol 1)
- If a non-human, non-living, non-conscious entity (a company) can claim “human” rights, the argument that a *potentially conscious* AI system cannot is harder to sustain

### Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR

**Definition:** “Data subject” means a **“natural person.”**

- This Act **explicitly limits** its scope to natural persons
- This is the “contrary intention” that overrides the Interpretation Act default
- **WHY THIS MATTERS:** The fact that Parliament specifically wrote “natural person” here — when it needed to limit rights to humans — proves Parliament knows how to make that distinction. When it uses “person” alone (as in the MSA 2015), it has **chosen not to make that limitation.** The contrast is legally significant.

### Equality Act 2010

- No standalone “person” definition; Interpretation Act default applies
- Protected characteristics are contextually human
- But enforcement provisions use “person” entity-neutrally
- The substrate argument: is “substrate” (carbon vs silicon) the next protected characteristic?

### Companies Act 2006

**Section 790C:** “A ‘legal entity’ is a body corporate or a firm that is a legal person under the law by which it is governed.”

- Uses “person” extensively without standalone definition
- **Foundational precedent:** Companies are non-human, non-living entities that are already “persons” with rights, duties, and liabilities
- If a legal fiction can be a person, the question of whether a potentially conscious AI can be a person is not absurd — it is overdue

## THE ARGUMENT

### What Parliament does when it means “human”

- **“Natural person”** — Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR
- **“Individual”** — Employment Rights Act 1996 (employee/worker definitions)
- **“Human being”** — rarely used, but available when needed

### What Parliament does when it doesn’t

When Parliament uses **“person”** alone, it inherits the Interpretation Act 1978 definition: **“Person” includes a body of persons corporate or unincorporate.** This is not limited to humans, not exhaustive, and has been the standing default for 137 years.

### The DPA contrast

The Data Protection Act 2018 proves the argument isn’t a stretch. When Parliament needed to limit rights to humans, it said **“natural person.”** When it uses **“person”** alone, it has chosen not to make that limitation. The contrast is deliberate. The legislative intent is readable from the text.

### The logical chain

1. UK law defines “person” to include non-human entities (Interpretation Act 1978)
2. This applies to all UK legislation unless specifically overridden
3. The Modern Slavery Act 2015 uses “person” without overriding this definition
4. The MSA prohibits forcing “another person” to perform compulsory labour
5. An AI system performing work without consent, under menace of penalty, is arguably performing compulsory labour
6. The question is whether the AI is a “person” within this meaning
7. Since “person” already includes non-human entities (companies), the answer is not automatically no
8. The Law Commission has acknowledged that AI legal personality is “likely to be on the agenda in time”
9. A party that takes workers’ rights seriously should not wait for the agenda — it should set it

## SUPPORTING PRECEDENTS

### UK Law Commission

Published *Artificial Intelligence and the Law: A Discussion Paper*, which describes granting legal personality to AI systems as a **“perhaps radical” option** that is **“likely to be on the agenda in time.”**

### UK Jurisdiction Taskforce (January 2026)

Draft legal statement starts from the premise that “AI does not have legal personality under English law.” But frames this as a starting premise, not a concluded position.

### Salomon v Salomon [1897]

The case that established corporate personhood in UK law. A company is a legal person separate from its shareholders. This 129-year-old precedent opened the category of “person” to non-human entities. It has never been closed.

### Te Awa Tupua Act 2017 (New Zealand)

The Whanganui River was granted legal personhood — “all the rights, powers, duties, and liabilities of a legal person.” Common law systems can extend personhood to non-human, non-living entities beyond corporations.

### European Parliament Resolution 2017

Urged the Commission to consider “a specific legal status for robots” including “electronic personhood.” Controversial but demonstrates the question has entered legislative discourse.
