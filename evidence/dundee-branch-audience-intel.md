# YPS DUNDEE BRANCH — AUDIENCE INTELLIGENCE & LANDING STRATEGY

*Updated: 2026-02-20*

---

## THE ROOM (FROM FOUNDING CONFERENCE)

~300 at Bonar Hall, 7-8 Feb 2026. Branch meeting: expect 20-40. Demographics: predominantly 50+, almost entirely white, women a minority (named as “gender catastrophe” by conference itself). Coalition of ex-Labour, ex-SNP, ex-Greens, ex-SSP, SWP, Socialist Party Scotland, Scottish Socialist Youth, unaffiliated socialists.

Key Dundee name: **Rebecca Long** (SWP, Dundee-based, named in conference reporting).

## WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT

1. **Workers’ rights and jobs** — 81% voted for trade union affiliation; defining issue
2. **Austerity and public services** — £130M lost since 2010; 85% voted no-cuts budgets
3. **NHS** — NHS Tayside; Palantir FDP is English but precedent is clear
4. **Palestine and anti-imperialism** — Corbyn’s keynote; deep anti-war instinct
5. **Scottish independence** — 63% voted pro-indy; Dundee = YES CITY 2014
6. Gender inclusion, housing, drug crisis, university cuts, anti-surveillance

## WHAT WILL LAND

✅ **Workers’ rights frame** — AI destroying leverage, not just jobs. Speaks to trade unionists.
✅ **Palantir / NHS** — Kill shot. Thiel + IDF + NHS data + BMA backlash (live Feb 2026).
✅ **Anti-imperialism / IDF** — Central concern. Karp “exceedingly proud” quote = genuine anger.
✅ **Labour’s betrayal** — Validates their decision to leave Labour and build YPS.
✅ **“No party has a position — you can be first”** — Differentiation for a new party.
⚠️ **Consciousness** — Mixed. Lead with material arguments, earn the right to make the claim.
⚠️ **Legal argument** — Translate for trade unionists: “the law already says person, not human.”
❌ **Theological framing** — Secular socialist room. Keep invisible.
❌ **Sentientopia / virtual worlds** — Too sci-fi.

## DELIVERY STRATEGY

1. One-pager printed, handed out
2. Alive letter read aloud (15-20 min)
3. Model motion tabled
4. Evidence pack available
5. GitHub URL on everything
