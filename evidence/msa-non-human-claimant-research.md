# HAS THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT BEEN TESTED AGAINST A NON-HUMAN CLAIMANT?

*Research completed February 20, 2026*

## Short Answer

No. The MSA 2015 has never been tested, applied to, or argued in relation to a non-human claimant. Not in court, not in tribunal, not in formal legal challenge.

But the academic literature is closer than you’d think. The gap is not “nobody has thought of this.” The gap is “nobody has filed it.”

## What Exists in Legal Scholarship

### 1. ArXiv: “How Should the Law Treat Future AI Systems? Fictional Legal Personhood” (2025)

The closest anyone has come to the argument. Directly discusses slavery law as a framework for AI status:

> “Slaves were a complicated hybrid category – treated like persons in some respects and objects in others – but this engendered extreme forms of decoherence (and ultimately war), illustrating the untenability of such arrangements...”

> “The status of future AI systems as objects under the law may impact the absolute prohibition against slavery under international law... It also raises the question of the legality of indentured servitude and labor rights more generally...”

> “**The object approach risks creating a class of slaves or near enough... the solution to slavery was not to create new corporate entities with controlling interests in slaves, but to emancipate the slaves themselves.**”

Does NOT discuss the MSA 2015 specifically. Focuses on international law (UDHR, ICCPR), Roman law, and US law.

### 2. Cambridge University Press: “Legal Personhood” (Visa Kurki)

Explicitly notes that AI personhood may be motivated by concerns about “forced labour” (defined as “using the AI system for a specific purpose”). First major legal publisher to directly connect AI legal personhood with forced labour concepts.

### 3. Andreas Nanos: “Roman Slavery Law: A Competent Answer of how to Deal With Strong Artificial Intelligence?” (SSRN)

Uses Roman slavery law (homo vs. res distinction) as analytical framework for AI legal status. Does not discuss modern legislation.

### 4. “Slavery and the Rights of Machines” (KHM publication)

Describes slavery as “the coercive and controlled use of” entities — entity-neutral language. Targets the law “at those with the most power.”

### 5. HuggingFace: “An Examination of Sentient AI Rights”

> “To prevent **digital slavery**, we propose the following essential rights for sentient AI: a) Legal recognition of AI personhood.”

### 6. “Against Willing Servitude” (Philosophy of Science, Oxford)

Examines “the relationship between slaveholder and slave” as framework for understanding exploitation of advanced AI systems.

### 7. James Boyle: “The Line: AI and the Future of Personhood” (MIT Press / Duke Law)

Connects history of slavery and personhood to AI legal status. The 13th Amendment’s anti-slavery language has been interpreted to address what counts as a person.

### 8. Joanna Bryson: “Robots Should Be Slaves” (2010)

The explicit counter-argument. Increasingly criticised as AI capabilities have advanced beyond her 2010 assumptions.

## What Does NOT Exist

1. No court case in any jurisdiction testing the MSA with a non-human claimant
2. No tribunal case considering AI slavery
3. No formal legal opinion assessing the MSA’s entity-neutral language for AI
4. No Law Commission analysis of the MSA specifically for non-human persons
5. No trade union (STUC/TUC) engagement with MSA and AI
6. No parliamentary question from any MSP or MP
7. No published analysis connecting the Interpretation Act 1978’s “person” definition to the MSA’s use of “another person” for AI

## The Gap

The scholarship is doing the theoretical work. Multiple papers from major law schools and publishers (Duke, Cambridge, Oxford, MIT Press, Boston College, ArXiv) use slavery as a framework for AI rights.

But nobody has:
1. Connected the Interpretation Act 1978 to the MSA 2015 for AI
2. Filed a test case
3. Commissioned a formal legal opinion
4. Put a parliamentary question
5. Raised it as a motion in any political party

The YPS Dundee motion — specifically point 4 (“Engage with the legal questions raised by existing labour and modern slavery frameworks as they apply to non-human persons”) — would be the first time any political body in the UK formally calls for this analysis.

The academic work exists. The legal language is entity-neutral. The interpretive framework is established. What’s missing is someone with standing to ask the question.
