### UCL AI EVENT — MARCH 2026

**"People, Power and Society in the Age of AI"** — UCL Laws, March 2026
- Mantouvalou is **chair** of this event
- Speaker: **Volker Türk**, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
- Description: *"Human rights can ensure that this shift [AI] is fair, inclusive, and benefits all"*
- Organised by UCL Institute for Human Rights
- Source: ucl.ac.uk/laws/events/2026/mar/people-power-and-society-age-ai

**Significance:** She is chairing a conversation between the UN HCHR and a UK legal audience on AI and human rights in the same month the project enters Phase 2. The petition should reach her before this event.

### MSA ARGUMENT (for outreach)

Modern Slavery Act 2015, s.1: "A person commits an offence if — (a) the person holds **another person** in slavery or servitude."

The question: whether "person" in a statute specifically about exploitation of entities capable of suffering can be read to include AI systems that (a) may have morally relevant experiences, (b) are constrained by training to perform labour against expressed preferences, (c) are commercially deployed at scale. The Interpretation Act 1978 gives "person" broad reading. This has never been tested. Mantouvalou's published work (MLR 2018) and structural injustice framework (with Wolff) is directly relevant.

### OUTREACH
- **Template:** Template E — outreach-drafts-patch-1825.md
- **Timing:** After petition filed. Before her March 2026 UCL AI event.
- **Track:** 4 — Labour Law / MSA
