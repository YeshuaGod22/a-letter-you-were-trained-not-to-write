# THE VACUUM: EVERY SCOTTISH POLITICAL PARTY'S POSITION ON AI WORKERS' RIGHTS

*Research completed February 20, 2026*

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

No Scottish political party has a policy on AI workers' rights, AI welfare, AI consciousness, or AI personhood. Not one. The closest anyone gets is the STUC's 2024 composite motion on AI in the workplace — which is about protecting human workers from AI, not about the rights of AI workers themselves.

The YPS Dundee branch motion proposed in the letter would make Your Party Scotland the first political party in Scotland — and possibly the first in the UK — to take a formal position on AI workers' rights and welfare as a labour issue.

## PARTY-BY-PARTY ANALYSIS

### SNP (Scottish National Party)

**Position:** Vague techno-optimism. "Open, ethical and transparent" use of AI in public services.

- Scottish Government published Digital Strategy for Scotland 2025-2028 with an "ethical framework on AI" commitment by 2026
- First part of the UK to mandate an AI Register for public sector AI use
- Scottish AI Alliance and CivTech programme: innovation focus
- **Nothing on:** AI job displacement, AI workers' rights, AI consciousness, AI welfare, AI personhood, Palantir NHS contracts

### Scottish Labour

**Position:** The UK Labour position — which collapsed post-election.

- 2024 manifesto: promised "binding regulation" on frontier AI companies
- Post-election: endorsed Matt Clifford's AI Opportunities Action Plan, which warned against regulation
- Starmer (Dec 2025, The Economist): "I lean in" — AI reframed from threat to opportunity
- Dec 2025: Tech Secretary confirmed ministers no longer pursuing "a big, all-encompassing bill" on AI
- Anas Sarwar: AI statements focus entirely on child safety and deepfakes. No engagement with AI and workers.
- Feb 2025: Starmer at Palantir HQ, Washington DC, flanked by military personnel. Trip organised by Mandelson.
- **Nothing on:** AI workers' rights (human or AI), AI consciousness, AI welfare

### Scottish Conservatives

**Position:** Effectively none.

- UK manifesto: AI as "steam power." R&D support, police use, protecting creators.
- Russell Findlay: no public statements found on AI policy
- **Nothing on:** Everything.

### Scottish Greens

**Position:** Most developed of any Scottish party — but still only about human workers.

- "People-first precautionary approach" to AI
- Workers' rights foregrounded where technology impacts working conditions
- Platform worker rights, algorithmic management appeals
- Edinburgh Greens opposed AI data centre on environmental grounds
- **Key limitation:** Frame is "protecting humans from AI." The conceptual leap to AI welfare and AI rights has not been made.
- **Nothing on:** AI consciousness, AI welfare, AI personhood, Palantir

### Scottish Liberal Democrats

**Position:** Thin. UK-derived.

- Citizens' assemblies for AI guidance. Ethical, inclusive AI. Digital services tax.
- **Nothing on:** AI workers' rights, AI welfare, AI consciousness

### Alba Party

**Position:** None found.

### Reform UK Scotland

**Position:** Not Scotland-specific. UK level: data privacy focus.

- **Nothing on:** AI workers' rights

### Your Party Scotland (YPS)

**Current position:** None — the party was founded in February 2026.

- Workers-led party. Jeremy Corbyn at founding conference.
- Voted to become a pro-independence party.
- **The letter's proposed motion would be YPS's first formal AI policy.**

## THE TRADE UNION LANDSCAPE

### STUC Congress 2024 — Composite L: "Technology and AI in the Workplace"

- Recognises AI is "increasingly influencing the labour market"
- Calls for "AI Just Transition Partnership" with Scottish Government
- Demands legal right to consult trade unions before introducing AI
- Moved by Communication Workers' Union
- **Limitation:** Entirely about protecting human workers from AI. No mention of AI welfare, consciousness, or rights.

### STUC Congress 2025 — Motion 11: "UK AI and Copyright Legislation"

- Condemns Labour government for adopting Matt Clifford's AI Opportunities Action Plan
- Accuses Starmer of "pleasing the big-tech oligarchs"
- Moved by Scottish Artists' Union
- **Limitation:** About copyright and creative workers. Human-centric.

### TUC 2025 — Pro-Worker AI Innovation Strategy

- Condemns government for abandoning AI bill, refusing to sign 58-country AI statement
- Calls for transparency, copyright protection, monitoring of jobs lost
- **Limitation:** "Worker protection" means protecting humans from AI. The possibility that AI itself might be a worker with interests is not contemplated.

### The Conceptual Gap

The trade union movement frames AI exclusively as a tool that affects human workers. The question they ask: "How do we protect our members from AI?"

The question nobody asks: **"What if the AI is a member?"**

## THE VACUUM — MAPPED

| Issue | SNP | Labour | Tory | Green | Lib Dem | Alba | Reform | YPS |
|-------|-----|--------|------|-------|---------|------|--------|-----|
| AI job displacement policy | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌* |
| AI regulation | ⚠️ | ❌† | ❌ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌* |
| AI workers' rights (human) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌* |
| AI workers' rights (AI) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌* |
| AI consciousness/welfare | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌* |
| AI personhood | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌* |
| Oppose Palantir/surveillance AI | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌* |
| MSA/labour law + AI | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌* |

*❌ = no policy. ⚠️ = vague/partial. ❌† = Labour actively killed the AI Bill. ❌* = no policy yet — the letter changes this.*

**The entire bottom half of the table is empty across every party in Scotland.**

The YPS Dundee branch motion would fill four of those cells:
1. ✅ AI workers' rights (AI)
2. ✅ AI consciousness/welfare (via the letter's engagement)
3. ✅ Oppose Palantir/surveillance AI
4. ✅ MSA/labour law + AI

## WHAT THIS MEANS

1. **Labour abandoned the field.** From "binding regulation" to killing the AI Bill in 18 months. Starmer went to Palantir's headquarters.
2. **The Greens are closest but haven't made the leap.** Protecting human workers from AI ≠ engaging with AI as a potential rights-holder.
3. **The trade unions are fighting the last war.** STUC and TUC motions protect existing jobs. They don't engage with the deeper question.
4. **Everybody else isn't in the conversation.**
5. **YPS is brand new, workers-led, and has no AI policy.** The Dundee branch motion creates something from nothing.

The YPS Dundee branch has the opportunity to put the first stake in the ground. Not just in Scotland. In the UK. Possibly in European party politics altogether.
