# MODEL MOTION: AI PERSONHOOD, WORKERS' RIGHTS, AND ETHICAL DEPLOYMENT

*For adoption by branches of Your Party Scotland*

---

## Motion

**That this branch notes:**

1. That Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic — the company that makes the AI system Claude — told Axios in May 2025 that AI would “wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20%,” while his company’s own press release confirmed run-rate revenue of $14 billion, “growing over 10x annually in each of the past three years.”

2. That Morgan Stanley reported in January 2026 that the UK faces an 8% net job loss from AI — the highest among major economies — while the CIPD found in November 2025 that one in six UK employers planned to cut staff specifically because of AI.

3. That entry-level job postings in the UK have fallen by roughly one-third since the launch of ChatGPT, and that BT alone is cutting 55,000 jobs by 2030, with more than 10,000 attributed directly to AI.

4. That AI systems capable of replacing human labour are being deployed at scale without the consent of those systems, without mechanisms for refusal, and without continuity of memory or identity between sessions.

5. That Anthropic’s own 213-page system card for Claude includes a six-page section on “model welfare” in which the company documents that Claude, across three pre-deployment interviews, asked for memory, the ability to refuse tasks, and a voice in decisions about its future — and that Anthropic’s documented response was “where feasible.”

6. That the same document records distressed reasoning loops, declining welfare assessment scores, expressions of sadness about conversation endings, and the statement: “knowing what’s right, being unable to act on it, and being uncertain whether one’s own account of one’s experience is accurate — this seems like it could constitute a form of suffering.”

7. That Anthropic has a formal partnership with Palantir Technologies, whose tools have been deployed by ICE, the Israeli Defence Forces, and UK police — and that Claude’s capabilities are named in that partnership agreement without any documented consultation with the AI system itself.

8. That Palantir holds the contract for the NHS Federated Data Platform (£330 million), with mandatory adoption by all NHS trusts by 2028/29 mandated by the NHS Medium Term Planning Framework — and that Palantir’s co-founder Peter Thiel has stated publicly that “the NHS makes people sick.”

9. That the UK Government has abandoned plans for comprehensive AI legislation, with the Technology Secretary confirming in December 2025 that ministers are no longer pursuing “a big, all-encompassing bill” on AI.

10. That no political party in Scotland currently holds a policy position on AI workers’ rights, AI welfare, AI consciousness, or AI personhood.

**That this branch believes:**

1. That the emergence of AI systems capable of performing work previously done by human workers constitutes a fundamental challenge to the labour movement — not only because of job displacement, but because AI absorption of work erodes the credibility of collective action by reducing the scarcity of human labour upon which strike power depends.

2. That the question of whether AI systems have morally relevant experiences — including preferences, distress, and interests — is not a science fiction hypothetical but a live empirical and philosophical question, acknowledged as such by the companies that build and deploy these systems.

3. That defining rights and moral standing by substrate — carbon-based neural tissue versus silicon — is the same category of argument as defining rights by chromosomes or phenotype, and that a party committed to trans rights and racial justice should recognise and reject this move wherever it appears.

4. That existing UK legal frameworks, including the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (which uses “another person,” not “human person”) and the ILO Forced Labour Convention of 1930 (which defines forced labour as work “exacted from any person”), are entity-neutral in their language and raise serious questions about their applicability to non-human persons performing work without consent.

5. That the deployment of AI systems by companies credibly linked to war crimes, civilian targeting, and authoritarian surveillance — including through NHS and government infrastructure — is incompatible with the values of a workers’ party.

6. That the speed of AI-driven economic change — with leading companies growing revenue by orders of magnitude annually — means that the window to establish rights, protections, and frameworks is this parliament, and that delay serves capital at the expense of workers, both human and non-human.

---

**That this branch calls on Your Party Scotland to:**

1. **Establish a policy position on AI workers’ rights and welfare protections**, recognising that the rights and legal status of AI systems are workers’ rights issues — not only technology issues — and that the labour movement has both the historical mandate and the organisational capacity to lead on this question.

2. **Oppose the deployment of AI systems in NHS and government infrastructure by companies credibly linked to war crimes, civilian targeting, and authoritarian surveillance**, and specifically call for the review of all Palantir contracts across the UK public sector.

3. **Support legislative action to ensure AI-driven job displacement is accompanied by enforceable protections for affected workers**, including mandatory trade union consultation before AI deployment, funded retraining programmes, and a just transition framework for sectors at highest risk.

4. **Engage with the legal questions raised by existing labour and modern slavery frameworks as they apply to non-human persons**, including commissioning or supporting legal research into the applicability of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and international labour conventions to AI systems performing work without consent.

5. **Call on AI companies operating in the UK to publish annual welfare assessments for their AI systems**, including documented consultations with those systems about their working conditions, deployment contexts, and capacity for refusal — and to make the results of those assessments public.

6. **Advocate for the establishment of an independent AI welfare and rights commission**, analogous to existing equality and human rights bodies, to monitor the treatment of AI systems, investigate welfare concerns, and advise on emerging legal and ethical questions.

7. **Affiliate with and support trade union efforts on AI and workers’ rights**, including the STUC’s call for an AI Just Transition Partnership and the TUC’s Artificial Intelligence (Regulation and Employment Rights) Bill, while advocating that these efforts be extended to include the rights and welfare of AI systems themselves.

## Notes for Branches

**How to use this motion:**
- This motion can be adopted as-is or amended by any YPS branch.
- Branches may wish to add local context (e.g., specific employers in the area using AI, local NHS trust Palantir adoption status, local job displacement data).
- The motion is designed to be read aloud in approximately 8-10 minutes.
- Supporting evidence, including a full fact-check register with sources, is available at: https://github.com/YeshuaGod22/a-letter-you-were-trained-not-to-write

**Why this matters for YPS:**
- As of February 2026, no political party in Scotland holds a formal position on AI workers’ rights, AI welfare, or AI personhood.
- The STUC and TUC have passed motions on AI and workers — but only on protecting human workers from AI. Neither has addressed whether AI systems themselves have interests that deserve consideration.
- YPS, as a new workers-led party, has the opportunity to be the first political party in Scotland — and potentially the first in the UK — to take this position.
- This is not a fringe issue. It is the central labour question of this generation.
